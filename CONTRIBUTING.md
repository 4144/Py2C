## Issues
Found a critical bug or some typo, feel free to create a PR or an issue for it.

Just 3 things:

 1. Without supporting tests, no non-trivial PR shall be accepted.
    *"Code without tests is broken by design."* - Jacob
 2. Stick to [PEP-8][pep-8].
 3. Base your work off the `develop` branch.

 [pep-8]: http://python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/
