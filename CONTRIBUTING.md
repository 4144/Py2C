So, you want to contribute? It's as simple as 1, 2, 3!
 1. Fork the repo.
 2. Start your work. Put that idea you have on paper, not code... :P.
 3. Submit a pull request.

At this point you're waiting on me. I'll try to respond to all pull requests as soon as I humanly can.

A bunch of things that I would like to mention:
 - Tests are lovely, one you have them...
 - PEP-8 has served me well as the Coding style guideline.
   *Please* stick to it.

And just in case I didn't emphasize enough: **I love tests!!**
