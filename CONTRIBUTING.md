# Contributing
To contribute to Py2C, just feel free to fork the repository and base your work off the `develop` branch.

Just 2 things:

 1. Write tests for whatever you write. *"Code without tests is broken by design."* Without tests, no code/PR shall be accepted.
 2. Stick to [PEP-8][pep-8].

 [pep-8]: http://python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/
