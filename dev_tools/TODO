To all those who are reading this, please note that this TODO file is used
with https://github.com/aziz/PlainTasks in Sublime Text, with
"Colour Scheme - Rainbow" as the tasks theme.

All TODOs marked with @contrib are open to contributions (via pull requests).

I do not have the time to guide anyone (including myself) through any of
these. But I hope the code and tests in the repository are self-explainatory.

There is another note-to-contributors.md file in this directory about my
mental plan/model of the translation process.

All times are IST.

General:
 - Get everything to use the 'logging' module (or possibly even use Logbook) @contrib @moderate
   Log every method call and arguments passed to it, with varying levels.
   This way, in case of mis-translations/crashes before code-generation,
   the debugging should be easier.
 ✔ Move over to git-flow ready scheme, by re-doing the history of the project. @done (31-December-2014 04:05PM)
   I've rebased madly and moved commits from one branch to another which isn't
   something I should've done... But then, no-one other than me had cloned the
   repository... So, it's all good I guess.

Packaging:
 ✔ Make packaging `pip` compatible. @easy @done (31-December-2014 04:20PM)

Testing:
 ✔ Make a streamlined testing environment, repeatable for every test run. @done (12-December-2014 05:03PM)
   Just create a new venv for each run. Set it up. Then run the tests there.
 ✔ Create a universal setup for all tests that allows describing each test. @done (12-December-2014 05:03PM)
   Allow for each test to be describe uniquely shown in a good-looking way,
   to make writing tests feel worthwhile.

Tree and Node Generator:
 ✔ Implement. @done (12-December-2014 05:03PM)
 ✘ [PACKAGING] Remove dependency on ply of node_gen.py (for parsing files). @cancelled (10-January-2015 04:26PM)
   This is really a might-do as since node_gen.py has been moved into the
   package, this dependency is not a problem in any way.
 ✔ Allow inheritence of fields in Node definitions. @done (04-January-2015 10:57AM)
 - [TESTS] Make RecursiveASTVisitor tests more comprehensive. @contrib @easy
 - [TESTS] Make RecursiveASTTransformer tests more comprehensive. @contrib @easy

Managers:
 ✔ Implement BaseManager @done (12-December-2014 05:03PM)
 - Implement PreProcessingManager
 - Implement AnalysisManager
 - Implement CodeGenerationManager
 - Implement TranslationManager

Configuration:
 ✔ Implement a simple system for configuration. @done (12-December-2014 05:03PM)
 - Integrate into all components.

Pre-processing:
 ✔ Implement a code to Python AST converter. @done (10-January-2015 04:24PM)
 - [TESTS] Make tests more comprehensive.
 - Implement a Python AST to FlowTree converter.

Nobody touch this section. Let me handle this on my own...
Analysis:
 ✔ Do some research into the subject. @done (14-12-28 10:10)
 - Figure out the appropriate model/structure for the analysis to done by. @started (01-January-2015 05:00PM)
 - Implement and Integrate. (-> "Implement AnalysisManager")
