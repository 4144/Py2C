## Py2C

[![Build Status][travis-badge]][travis-page] [![Coverage Status][coveralls-badge]][coveralls-page]

A trans-compiler for compiling Python code into human-readable C++ code, somewhat like what humans might actually write. It would have to be really smart and that's the aim!

In this branch of the repository, the code will always be working. This is also the branch from where releases shall be made.
